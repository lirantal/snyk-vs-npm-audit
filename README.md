| About Snyk      | [Snyk](https://snyk.io) is a developer-first security company, providing free and commercial developer tooling and platform to find and fix security vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, container images, and infrastructure as code
| About npm audit | [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) is the open source package manager and [public registry](https://www.npmjs.com) for JavaScript packages.

If any vulnerabilities are found, then the impact and appropriate remediation will be calculated.
