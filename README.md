## About Snyk and npm audit

|       Tool      | Background     
| :-------------: | -------------- 
| About Snyk      | [Snyk](https://snyk.io) is a developer-first security company, providing free and commercial developer tooling and platform to find and fix security vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, container images, and infrastructure as code
| About npm audit | [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) is the open source package manager and [public registry](https://www.npmjs.com) for JavaScript packages. The npm package manager includes a built-in security tool in the form of the `npm audit` command which submits a description of the dependencies configured in your project to the npm registry and asks for a report of known vulnerabilities. If any vulnerabilities are found, then the impact and appropriate remediation will be calculated.

## Observed issues with npm audit

The following are a list of cases and experiences which have been observed with using npm audit
and are deemed problematic for a security tool:

- [1 npm audit reports false positives](#1-npm-audit-reports-false-positives)
- [tbd](#tbd)
- [tbd](#tbd)

### 1 npm audit reports false positives

‚ùå **Case**: npm audit reports false positives in such a way that packages that were once vulnerable but later in the future received a fix, are still reported as vulnerable across versions. npm fails to stay up to date with patches applied to libraries and ends up completely missing out on them.

üëâ **Example**: https://github.com/pillys/fs-path/pull/5

‚úÖ **The Snyk case**: Snyk‚Äôs security analysts are always monitoring vulnerable packages for new releases, and manually triage them for fixes or other updates that are significantly impacting the state of the package or vulnerability.
